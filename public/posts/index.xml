      <description>1. Who am I? Greetings to all. I&amp;rsquo;m Duong, a student at Vietnam National University&amp;rsquo;s University of Information Technology. I am interested in learning programming as well as many other subjects, including philosophy, football,&amp;hellip; I have a strong preference for backend development, which will be my primary area of employment. 2. What is this website? Every day, I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn something new. I made this website in an effort to better my writing abilities and to help me remember the information I learnt for a longer period of time.</description>
