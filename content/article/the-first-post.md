## 1. Who am I?

Greetings to all. I'm Duong, a student at Vietnam National University's University of Information Technology. I am interested in learning programming as well as many other activities, including gaming, football,...    

I have a strong preference for backend development, which will be my primary area of employment.

## 2. What is this website?

Every day, I'm going to learn something new. I made this website in an effort to better my writing abilities and to help me remember the information I learnt for a longer period of time.  

> So let's adhere to it.
